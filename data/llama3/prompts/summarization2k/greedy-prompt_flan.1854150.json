Take Russell Crowe, for example. The 48-year-old Aussie was recently rescued by U.S. Coast Guard when he lost his way kayaking in the waters off New York's Long Island. However, it wasn't his dramatic rescue most people were talking about -- it was his dramatic weight gain. Crowe is currently filming Darren Aronofsky's Noah, and the actor apparently needed to gain some weight for the role. This isn't the actor's first time he's packed on the pounds for a film.
